 •	Explain API types and the benefits of APIs, and analyses the differences between API and SDK.
## 1 – API types:
- Open APIs: Also known as Public API, there are no restrictions to access these types of APIs because they are publicly available.
- Partner APIs: Because this sort of API is not available to the general public, a developer must have particular permissions or licenses in order to utilize it.
- Internal APIs: Also known as Private APIs, only internal systems expose this type of API. These are usually designed for internal use within a company.
- Composite APIs: Different data and service APIs are combined in this sort of API. It is a set of tasks that run synchronously as a result of their execution rather than at the task's request.
 Its primary functions are to speed up the execution process and to increase the performance of listeners in web interfaces.

6- Features

 |SDK | API| 
|-----|-----|
|Software Development Kit|Application Programming Interface
|It's a set of tools, code samples, and documentation.| It's a pre-defined interface to a set of software capabilities.
|Windows 7 SDK|Windows API
|Tool|Interface
|It generally includes an API or two|It comes independently or as a member of SDK
|Provides programmers with tools to aid in the creation and usage of the API.|The interface gives you access to the platform's capabilities and features.
