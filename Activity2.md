- API: An application programming interface (API) is a way for computers or computer programs to communicate with one another.
It's a sort of software interface that provides a service to other programs. A document or standard that explains how to create such a link.
 - API Usage : APIs connect user-facing front ends to critical back-end functionality and data in web applications. APIs are used to deliver material by streaming services like Spotify and Netflix.
APIs are used by automakers such as Tesla to provide software upgrades. Others utilize APIs to make automobile data available to third parties.
- API Endpoints/Request URLs:An endpoint is simply one end of a communication connection. The touchpoints of contact between an API and another system are referred to as endpoints. A URL of a server or service can be included in an endpoint for APIs. Each endpoint is a location where APIs may have access to the resources they require to do their tasks.

APIs are based on the concept of ‘requests' and ‘responses.' An API will get a response when it asks information from a web application or web server. 
An endpoint is the location where APIs send requests and where the resource resides.

- Authentication Key: The property gained while executing a key setup protocol (Key Agreement and Key Management) is key authentication, 
- in which one entity has the confidence that only a specifically specified other party knows the agreed key.
